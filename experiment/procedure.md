# Procedure:- 

### Configuration:-
- select motor size , arm length and check/click the configuration button. (we are considering standard single phase motor sizes).
- click on next level 

### Basic Knowledge - 
- Answer all the questions and click on next level.

### Part A-
- Start the cold water pump for cooling system.
- start the induction motor with no load condition and check the torque sensor reading.
- calculate the standard torque (upto two decimals) for no load condition and submit the answer.
- load the weight , start induction motor and check the sensor torque reading.
- calculate the standard torque (upto two decimals) for load condition and submit the answer.
- Repeat the same process for loading the till the maximun weights.
- Observe the reading , calculate the standard torque for every observation and submit the answer.
- plot the graph by clicking on "show graph" button after taking atleast 5-6 readings.



### Calibration
1. Calculate zero error(minimum value) upto two decimals and click on submit(Formula: Actual Reading - Observed Reading). 
2. Similarly calculate span error(maximum value) upto two decimals and click on submit(Formula: Actual Reading - Observed Reading).
3. Observe the graph and then adjust zero by clicking "plus" and "minus" buttons. 
4. Once zero error is calibrated then calibrate span error with same process as mentioned in step 3.
5. When span error is calibrated it disturbs zero. Again adjust zero and follow the process as mentioned in step 3. 
6. After adjusting zero and span error click on "Next Level" button to move on next level.


### Part B - 
- Start the cold water pump for cooling system.
- select the speed of the motor and weight.
- start the induction motor with loading condition and check the torque sensor reading.
- calculate the standard torque for loading condition and submit the answer.
- Repeat the above process , increasing maximun loading weights with same speed.
- plot the graph by clicking on "show graph" button after 5-6 readings and observe the characterisation graph.
(while changing the speed of motor, start loading the motor with minimum to maximum weight.) 
- click on "Next level" button to go next level.

### Fault Finding:
1. Observe the shown table and select the fault accordingly.
2. After selecting the correct fault Result will be displayed.
